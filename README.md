### Tips

#### Before the hack

#####  Plan ahead
* Familiarize yourself with any new tools you might want to play with
* Map out your objects / relationships if you already have an idea

##### During the hack

* Think Small and Simple
* Have a big picture in mind, map it out
*Only aim to build MVP (minimum viable product) and showcase core features/flow, don't get caught up in bitty things, e.g. user auth, tests, moving that image to the exact pixel
* When planning, break up deliverables into milestones. If you don't make it to the final milestone at least you have a finished deliverable to present

##### Don't forget about the pitch

* It's not all about the dev/design details, the presentation is also vital - don't de-prioritise it

##### Teamwork

* Success at a hack is all about planning well and dividing your work across your team as much as possible. Be cross-collaborative and communicative even across other teams. Don't silo yourself / try to take on too much responsibility!

##### Can-do attitude

* Don't let yourself block you. Resolve to the fact a lot of things will feel new - you have the internet and supportive people around you to help you learn all the things. Be prepared to surprise yourself with how much you'll learn in a weekend

##### Your sanity / health

* This still comes first. Get some sleep! Go for a quick walk! Joke around with your team members and post funny GIFs on slack. Enjoy the experience, don't let it stress you out.
